        <h2>CodeSandbox and our platform</h2>
        <p>To save you some work, so you don't have to download and install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment),
            we use <a href="https://codesandbox.io">CodeSandbox</a>, which is an online development environment
            that you can use for smaller projects. It comes with a lot of good features. Generally speaking IDE is a
            place/program/application where you can create your code and develop a website or an app.</p>
        <h3>How to get your own development environment</h3>
        <p>On this <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/gfa-workshop-nuhky">link</a> you can find a ready-made development
            environment that we use in our Green Fox Academy Workshops. To be able to work on your own version of our
            project, it is important to create your own copy. In the top bar, it is the fourth button from the right -
            the FORK button. When you click on it, you will create your own copy of this environment.
        </p>
        <img src="Fork.png" alt="How to fork our project">
        <h3>Development environment</h3>
        <p>If you successfully created your own copy of our project. You should see something like this:</p>
        <img src="Environment.png" alt="Development environment">
        <p>The <span class="redNuber">1.</span> box is your project file system. If you want to work on specific task
            firsly open the workshop folder, then
            open the <code>script.js</code> file inside a folder with the number of the task and put your code
            inside. Do not change other files in our project as it might result in your copy not working at all. If this
            for some reason happens just create a new one.

            The <span class="redNuber">2.</span> box is where you should write your code. You can find a lot of hints
            there to help you solve the tasks, but you can also always get back to this knowledge base to learn
            something new. Do not forget to save your work with <code>ctrl+s</code> (the cursor must be in the code
            section). If you don't save your work regularly you might delete it by refreshing the whole page.

            The <span class="redNuber">3.</span> box is small browser, where you can see your project immediately.
            We have prepared a project for you, which you can take as your portfolio of the first small steps in
            programming. You can see what the home page of this environment looks
            like in the small browser on the right. Here you can find links to your solutions. Simply select the
            exercise you want to view and click on it. You can then return to the menu by pressing the back button (if
            you are directly on the web), or by clicking the refresh button in a small browser (if you are in the code
            sandbox). If necessary, just copy the link and hit enter.
        </p>
        <h3>Platform problems</h3>
        <p>Nothing is perfect, neither is this online IDE. From time to time you might see an error in the mini browser.
            In that case just save your work with <code>ctrl+s</code> (the cursor must be in the code section) and
            refresh the page. The reason for this error is a bundler CodeSandbox uses. </p>

    <section id="javascript">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This language can be found mainly in web development. You've probably heard of HTML and CSS before. HTML is
            the markdown code that we use to create web pages. It is only a static skeleton of the content, for example
            what is the title, what is the text, image, etc. A good analogy is that HTML can be seen as a dummy (plastic
            model of a person used in clothes shop for showing clothes). CSS adds styles to our HTML, with the help of
            CSS we can add colors, layout, etc. to our page. If the HTML is a dummy, then CSS is the clothes we put on
            it. And finally here's the javascript, it will help us add a little dynamics to our site. Animation, dynamic
            layout, etc. With Javascript, our dressed dummy changes into a dressed man who can move. JavaScript is a
            so-called interpreted language, which means that the interpreter that is built into your browser understands
            the individual commands that you write in the code.
        </p>
        <p>Learn more about JavaScript from the official
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">documentation</a></p>
    </section>

    <section id="ourConsole">
        <h2>Our console</h2>
        <p>To try basic concepts of JavaScript, you can use our Console. Just open the console <code>script.js</code>
            inside the folder number 1. There are two methods you can use to work with our console. First is <code>print(text)</code>
            to print something to a console. It can be either text (string) or a number. Second method is
            <code>clear()</code> to clear the console. Once you learn more about conditions, loops and functions get
            back to this console and try these concepts out.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
let number = 23;
let text = "Green Fox Academy is a coding bootcamp in Prague.";
print(number);
print(text);</code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="jsConsole">
        <h2>JavaScript Console</h2>
        <p>Our console is very basic, but you can try out most of the concepts covered in Green Fox Academy Workshop
            with it. If you want to print more interesting stuff (objects, arrays, etc.) you need to use JavaScript
            console. You can open this console by pressing <code>ctrl+shift+j</code> on Windows or <code>command+option+j</code>
            on Mac. Alternatively, right-click somewhere in your webpage and "inspect element". You should see something
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="Console.png" alt="JavaScript console">
        <p>In case you don't just find the right tab (Console). Here you can do pretty much the same as in CodeSandbox -
            create variables, add/substract them, work with conditions, loops, functions and a lot more. It is just not
            that comfortable. So the real reason for using JavaScript console is <code>console.log()</code>. With this
            method we can log anything to our console. It can be truly anything - number, text (string), object, array,
            HTML element, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
            <code>
let number = 23;
let text = "Green Fox Academy is a coding bootcamp in Prague.";
let array = [23,68,24,34,33,77,12];
let car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
console.log(number);
console.log(text);
console.log(array);
console.log(car);</code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can also open console directly in CodeSandbox, just click on console below the small browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>These informations are related to part 2 - Basics. Open the folder 2 in workshop folder.</p>
        <h3>fillRect()</h3>
        <p>In the <code>script.js</code> file you can see one function called <code>draw()</code>, at this moment we
            don’t really
            care about what exactly that means. Let's first take a look at what is written inside this function.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    c.fillRect(20,20,200,150);
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            As the name suggests, this function draws a rectangle on the canvas. The
            letter c before the function is the name of the object that can draw on the canvas. The dot is a
            „connector“. In the language of programmers, this would mean something like: "I call the fillRect function
            on object c.“ Numbers in brackets are called parameters or arguments. Please note the semicolon at the end
            of the line. When the interpreter sees this semicolon it recognise that the line no longer continues. It's
            the same as the dot at the end of the sentence. When I change the value to:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    c.fillRect(200,100,300,50);
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>The rectangle shifts and resizes. You should now be able to determine what each number means. The first of
            these (200) is the number of pixels from the left edge, ie where we want to start our rectangle on the
            x-axis. The second of them (100) is the number of pixels from the top edge, ie where we want to start our
            rectangle on the y-axis. The third number is the width of the rectangle and the fourth is its height. It's
            important to realize that these axes are a little different then what we remember from math classes. In
            mathematics, the point [0,0] is located in the lower left corner. However, in the IT world, this point is in
            the upper left corner.
        </p>
        <h3>StrokeRect()</h3>
        <p>There are other methods we can use when painting on canvas. The <code>strokeRect()</code> method draws only
            the outline of the rectangle.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
export function draw(c) {
    c.strokeRect(200, 200, 300, 50);
}</code>
    </pre>
        <p>What about adding some colors? Use this command to change the color of drawing objects.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    c.fillStyle = "red";
    c.strokeStyle = "blue";
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>FillStyle and strokeStyle are not functions of object c, but its attributes. And we can assign a value to the
            attribute. In our case, it will be the name of the color in English. You can try any color that comes to
            your mind. Eg: pink, purple, crimson, salmon.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="comments">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>In programming languages we have the opportunity to add comments to our code. This makes easier to understand
            complicated parts or for example to add notes during learning. Commented lines start with <code>//</code> or
            placed
            between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>. The commented code won't get executed, it is only for the
            reader.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
// this is an inline comment, the browser will ignore it

/*
    this is a multiline comment
    the browser will ignore the whole block
*/</code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Now we are going to get familiar with variables, types and operators. These are the really fundamentals in
            programming languages, not only in JavaScript, however their usage or syntax can slightly vary.</p>
        <h3>Declaration</h3>
        <p>A variable is a piece of memory where we can store a value. It is name-value pair and can be defined/declared
            with several different keywords. In Green Fox Academy Workshop we use the keyword <code>let</code>.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let variable;
let otherVariable;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Above we have created two variables, their names are variable and otherVariable respectively. Currently they
            have no value assigned. If you want to a assign a value to your variable, you will need to use the =
            operator:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let number = 5;
let name = "Fox";</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Let's break it down now. The word let denotes a variable, followed by the name of the variable, then the =
            sign means that we want to store a value in this variable. The value depends on what is behind the
            equal sign. We can store many things in variables, more about this topic can be found <a
                    href="#types">here</a>.
            It is good practice to name variables in a way that makes sense. The variable name should
            describe what the variable is used for.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you try to declare two variables with the same name (redeclaration), then you
            will get an
            error. In this case you need to ignore the let keyword for the second time or use another variable name.</p>
        <p>After a variable has been declared you can change its value any time with the = sign:</p>
        <img src="variables.png" alt="variables showcase">
        <p><strong>Extra info:</strong> You can use <code>const</code> and <code>var</code> for variable declarations
            and all these 3 behaves differently. <code>let</code> is perfectly enough for us now, but you can read about
            them in the
            most referenced <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements#Declarations">documentation</a>,
            maintained by Mozilla and the community.</p>

        <h3 id="types">Types</h3>
        <p>Now after we know what are variables, lets examine what can be their values. As we've seen earlier, we have
            numbers for example. Is this enough for us? Nope, except if we want to create a calculator, but as the
            application gets more complicated we will need more types. In JavaScript we have 7 different primitive
            (basic) data types, but we will learn about only 3 of them:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#number"><strong>number:</strong></a> any number, both integer and rational numbers</li>
            <li><a href="#string"><strong>string:</strong></a> they represents any text or a single character</li>
            <li><a href="#boolean"><strong>boolean:</strong></a> it has two values true or false</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="boolean">Boolean</h4>
        <p>Lets start with the simplest type, Boolean. It is a pretty common type and we have it in almost every
            language. It has only two values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let myBoolean = true;
let myOtherBoolean = false;</code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Logical operators</h5>
        <p>Operators which can be used with boolean values are called <code>logical operators</code> the most common
            ones are <code>or (||)</code> and <code>and (&&)</code>. We consider these operators binary operators as
            they work with two values. There is also unary operators <code>not (!)</code>.</p>
        <p>To understand the <code>logical and operator</code> we can use a table</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>value1</th>
                <th>value2</th>
                <th>result</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>true</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>false</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>false</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>false</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>So in a nutshell <code>logical and</code> will result true only if both values are true</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = true && true;
// result equals to true

let result2 = true && false;
//result2 equals to false</code>
        </pre>
        <p><code>Logical or</code> is pretty similar to the and, but its result is always true if at least one operand
            is true.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>value1</th>
                <th>value2</th>
                <th>result</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>true</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>true</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>true</td>
                <td>true</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>false</td>
                <td>false</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = true || true;
// result equals to true

let result2 = true || false;
//result2 equals to true

let result3 = false || false || true || false;
// result3 equals to true

let result4 = false || false;
// result4 equals to false</code>
        </pre>
        <p><code>not</code> is a unary operator which means it has only one operand. It simply negates the value.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = !true;
// result equals to false

let result2 = !false
// result2 equals to true</code>
        </pre>
        <p>What do you think what will be the result of <code>!!true</code>? Lets try it and find out why did you get
            that result.</p>
        <h5>Assignement operators</h5>
        <p>With the <code>equals operator (===)</code> you can check if the operands are equals or not. This operator
            can be used with all the other types but will always result a boolean.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = true === true;
// result equals to true

let result2 = true === false;
// result2 equals to false

let result3 = false === false;
// result3 equals to true

let result4 = 5 === 5;
// result4 equals to true</code>
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> there is another equals operator <code>==</code> which works almost the same way,
            but in some cases they will have different result. As a good practice we encourage everybody to use the
            triple variant.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>not equals operator (!==)</code> is the counterpart of the equals, you can check with it whether
            two values are different or not.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = true !== true;
// result equals to false

let result2 = true !== false;
// result2 equals to true

let result3 = 1 !== 2;
// result3 equals to true</code>
        </pre>
        <h4 id="number">Numbers</h4>
        <p>Numbers represents anything between <code>-Infinity</code> and <code>Infinity</code> and you can do any
            operation with them what you already did in the elementary school.</p>
        <p><strong>Extra info:</strong> Some languages have specific types for rational numbers but in JavaScript there
            is only number, regardless to its value.</p>
        <h5>Mathematical operators</h5>
        <p>Just like in math you can do different operations with numbers. Most of them you know from your elementary
            school times.
        <ul>
            <li>Addition <code>+</code></li>
            <li>Substraction <code>-</code></li>
            <li>Multiplication <code>*</code></li>
            <li>Division <code>/</code></li>
            <li>Modulo <code>%</code></li>
        </ul>
        The first three of these operators <code>(+,-,*)</code> work as you expect them to work. You can try in out in a
        console.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let addition = 5 - 6;
// addition equals to -1

let substraction = 5 - 6;
// substraction equals to -1

let multiplication = 5 * 6;
// multiplication equals to 30</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Division is almost the same too, but there is a slight difference. In math, you cannot divide by zero. In
            JavaScript you can get a strange result.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let result = 10 / 4;
// result is 2.5

let result2 = 10 / 0;
// result2 is Infinity</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Modulo is less known but we do have it in math too. With modulo you can get the reminder of a division. It is
            quite important operator in programming world.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let reminder = 5 % 3;
//reminder is 2;</code>
        </pre>
        <h4 id="string">Strings</h4>
        <p>Strings represents any text or character in programming languages, you just need to use quotation marks such
            as <code>'</code> or <code>"</code>.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let myString = 'This is a string';
let anotherString = "This is also a string";</code>
        </pre>
        <p>We have a special form of strings as well, called <code>string template literal</code>. We use them, when we
            want to make something dynamic. For this you will need to use some more special characters:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let name = 'Mark';
let greeting = `Hello ${name}!`;
// greeting equals to "Hello Mark!"</code>
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Mind the special characters, we used the backtick <code>`</code> instead of
            simple quotation marks and surrounded the variable with ${...}</p>
        <h5>Operators</h5>
        <p>There are several operation what can be performed on strings but we will focus only on two of them. First of
            them is <code>concatenation (+)</code> and second is <code>.length</code> operator.</p>
        <p>With the <code>+</code> sign you can append/concatenate a string to another.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let greetWorld = 'Hello ' + 'World!';
//greetWorld equals to "Hello World!"

let name = 'Dave';
let greeting = 'Hello ' + name + '!';
// greeting equals to "Hello Dave!"</code>
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> As you can see the result is the same as with <code>string template
            literals</code>, these
            template literals are pretty new in JavaScript and preferred over the concatenation.</p>
        <p>Strings in JavaScript have a property, called <code>length</code>. With this property you can get the count
            of characters in the string.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let charCount = 'Hello'.length;
// charCount equals to 5</code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="colors">
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>Having only black and white drawing can be kind of boring. We can change the color of our future drawings by
            changing the property <code>strokeStyle</code> or <code>fillStyle</code>. These properties belong to the
            context <code>c</code> defined in <code>canvas</code>. The default color is black, once you change the color
            all of the next drawings are using this color, untill you change it again. <code>strokeStyle</code> changes
            the color of the outline of a rectangle. <code>fillStyle</code> changes the fill color. We can simply use
            the english names of colors. The list of possible colors is really long.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
// This rectangle is going to be black
c.fillRect(50,50,100,100);

// Now we change the color to red
c.fillStyle = "red";
// This one is going to be red
c.fillRect(50,50,100,100);

// Same for just the outline (stroke)
c.strokeRect(50,50,100,100);
c.strokeStyle = "red";
c.strokeRect(50,50,100,100);</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>RGB notation</h3>
        <p>The list of colors whose names we can use right away is long enough, but it certainly lacks some colors.
            There is another way how we can represent a color in JavaScript - RGB. RGB color values are supported in all
            browsers. An RGB color value is specified with: <code>rgb(red, green, blue)</code>. Each parameter (red,
            green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(0, 0,
            255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are
            set to 0.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
// Setting color to red
c.fillStyle = "rgb(255,0,0)";

// Setting color to blue
c.fillStyle = "rgb(0,255,0)";

// Setting color to green
c.fillStyle = "rgb(0,0,255)";

// Setting color to purple - 50% of red, 0% of green and 50% of blue
c.fillStyle = "rgb(128,0,128)";</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>RGBA notation</h3>
        <p>In addition to RGB notation, we can also use RGBA notation, the last parameter indicates the opacity of
            the object. Value <code>1</code> means opacity and value <code>0</code> means absolute transparency.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
// Red color with 50% opacity
c.fillStyle = "rgba(255,0,0,0.5)</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Because both of these notations are strings we can create them using <code>string template literal</code> or
            <code>concatenation</code> and include some variables.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let opacity = 0.1;
c.fillStyle = `rgba(0,0,0, ${opacity * 3})`;</code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="conditions">
        <h2>Conditions</h2>
        <p>You can make a piece of your code optional, with the if statement. It lets you define a condition which your
            code depends on</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let myVariable = false;
if (myVariable === true) {
    console.log('The condition has been evaluated to true');
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>If you run the above code in the console or in a webpage you will see nothing in the console. Please change
            something to see the desired message in the console</p>
        <p>Our if statement gives us more capabilities, we can tell what we want to do if the given condition has been
            evaluated to false.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let a = 7;
if (a < 5) {
    console.log(a / 2);
} else {
     console.log(a * 2);
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can read more about the if statement in the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if…else">documentation</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="loops">
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to execute a piece of code several times. Like in the real life when you want to move
            books from one shelf to another.
        <ul>
            <li>you grab the book</li>
            <li>you move it to the other shelf</li>
            <li>you release the book</li>
        </ul>
        And you do this until you have no books to move. For example if you have 10 books:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let bookCount = 10;

for (let i = 0; i < bookCount; i++) {
    // here comes the code which moves the books
    // this block will be repeated bookCount times
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>For indicates the beginning of a new for-loop, followed by the initialization of the variable i, the
            condition, and the change of the variable. The most important part of for-loop for us is the condition. If
            the condition is true, the commands in curly brackets are going to be executed.</p>
        <p>Printing the number of current book is also fairly easy. We call the number of a loop (book in our case) an
            index</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>We already know what parts the for-loop consists of. But what exactly that change part means?</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let i = 0;
// These 3 statements means exactly the same - addition of 1 to current value of i
i++;
i=i+1;
i+=1;

// Same with substraction
i--;
i=i-1;
i-=1;

// If we want to add more then one, then there are only 2 options
i+=10;
i=i+10;
i-=10;
i=i-10;</code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="drawing">
        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>We already know how to draw a rectangle or its outline. We can also draw any other shape by drawing single
            lines. Following example will draw a triangle.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    c.beginPath();
    c.moveTo(100, 30);
    c.lineTo(150, 115);
    c.lineTo(50, 115);
    c.lineTo(100, 30);
    c.stroke();
    c.fill();
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Imagine that there is an invisible hand that draws on the canvas for you. We have to start drawing with the
            <code>beginPath</code> function, which wakes the invisible hand to life. With the <code>moveTo</code>
            function we can move the hand to a specific place. Finally, the invisible hand begins to draw with invisible
            ink on the canvas with the<code>lineTo</code> function. Once it's done, we call the <code>stroke</code>
            function and the ink appears. This is how we can draw a triangle. Using the <code>fill</code> method instead
            of the <code>stroke</code> method, we can fill the object with color, but only if the object is closed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="functions">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>Usually there are many repeating code blocks in an application, when we want to execute the same code but
            with different circumstances/environments. Just imagine how you pay your bills. The steps are the same you
            just transfer different amount to different bank accounts. So the amount and the bank account are parameters
            of this activity. In programming languages these activities are called functions.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
function payBill(amount, beneficiary) {
    // transfer amount money to the beneficiary
};</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Within functions you can use the return keyword which will give back the function's output. For example if
            you want to add 2 numbers, then you will need the result as well:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;  // the return keyword will give you back the result
};

console.log(add(1, 2)) // will print 3</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Another example of function for drawing a square. Squares are rectangles with width being equal to
            height.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    function strokeSquare(left, top, size) {
        c.strokeRect(left, top, size, size);
    }
    strokeSquare(100,100,200);
}
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The keyword function means that we are starting to declare a new function. This is followed by the name of
            this function, its parameters in brackets, and the body of the function in curly brackets. In our case we
            want to draw squares, 3 parameters are enough for that. <code>left</code> - how much from the left edge.
            <code>top</code> - how much from the top edge. <code>size</code> - what should be the size of the square. In
            the body of the function, we only pass these parameters to the already known strokeRect function.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="events">
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>So far you can draw on canvas with the help of variables, conditions and loops. With the help of HTML and CSS
            you can create nice dynamic website. This sounds cool, but still not enough. The user might want to interact
            with your webpage. Do actions like clicking on a button, save some data during sign up or simply like/share
            some content. This is where we will need the events. Events are actions made by the user and we want to
            respond to them
            somehow. Let's see how events work on an example. We want to create a program that will draw foxes on the
            canvas when moving the mouse over the canvas. To do this, we will need a method for drawing foxes. Let the
            method be:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
export function draw(c) {
    function drawFox(x, y) {
        let size = 20;

        c.beginPath();
        c.moveTo(x, y);
        c.lineTo(x+size/7*2, y-size/7*3);
        c.lineTo(x+size/7*3, y-size/7);
        c.lineTo(x+size/7*4, y-size/7);
        c.lineTo(x+size/7*5, y-size/7*3);
        c.lineTo(x+size, y);
        c.lineTo(x+size/2, y+size/7*3);
        c.lineTo(x, y);
        c.fill();
    }
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>We have a method, now we have to tell JavaScript when to use this method. First, we select the part of the
            screen that contains our canvas. In HTML we can find that this part uses an <code>id</code> named canvas.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
let canvas = window.document.getElementById("canvas");</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Now we need to add event listener to this canvas.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', function(e) {
    // Here we will put the code that is going to be executed, when the event is triggered
});</code>
        </pre>
        <p>To this function we can add whatever we want to happen if the mouse is moved. This is the reason of the name
            of this event – <code>mousemove</code>.</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
    drawFox(e.clientX, e.clientY);
});
</code>
        </pre>
        <p><code>e.clientX</code> and <code>e.clientY</code> are coordinates of the mouse when the event happened. Full
            code of this example can be found in part 10 of the workshop.</p>
